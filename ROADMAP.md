## Phase Roadmap

This roadmap uses a **rolling detail** pattern: only the next sprint has task-level planning. Future phases have milestone-level descriptions. After each sprint completes, the next sprint is promoted to detailed planning.

> **Sprint numbering rule**: Sprint numbers are strictly sequential (see CLAUDE.md § Sprint Numbering & Re-prioritization). Phase-to-sprint mappings below are projections. When execution order changes, the Orchestrator replans affected sprints and updates these mappings — sprint numbers are never skipped or reordered.

### Phase 1 — Rule Engine Completion + Payroll Chain (Sprints 4–5)

**Priority focus**: P2 (Deterministic rule engine), P3 (Event sourcing), P6 (Payroll integration)

The critical gap is payroll integration — infrastructure exists but the end-to-end traceability chain is disconnected. Phase 1 connects rules to payroll export and completes the absence type inventory.

- **Sprint 4** (complete): Absence completion, flex payout, PeriodCalculationService "glue", payroll export endpoint, traceability regression tests
- **Sprint 5** (complete): Flex endpoint unification, on-call duty basics, event emission + HTTP parallelization, retroactive correction foundation, SLS export format, 158 tests

### Phase 2 — RBAC, Local Config, Period Approval + Frontend (Sprints 6–8)

**Priority focus**: P7 (Security), P9 (Usability)

Does not affect the deterministic core. Focuses on organizational hierarchy, local configuration, period approval, and user-facing completeness.

- **Sprint 6** (complete): 5-role RBAC foundation, organizational hierarchy (materialized path), scope-embedded JWT, DB-backed auth, 8 new domain events, 21 new tests (179 total). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-6.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-6.md).
- **Sprint 7** (complete): Org-scope enforcement, local config + period approval + admin CRUD + config endpoints, approval guard on payroll export. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-7.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-7.md).
- **Sprint 8** (complete): Frontend design system, 20 UI components, auth context, API client, role-based navigation, 6 admin/approval/config pages, route guards, 25 frontend tests. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-8.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-8.md).

### Phase 2b — Skema (Sprint 9)

**Priority focus**: P3 (Event sourcing), P7 (Security), P9 (Usability)

**Re-prioritized**: Sprint 9 was originally projected for Phase 3 (Advanced Rules). The Skema monthly spreadsheet feature was re-prioritized as Sprint 9 (Tier 2 re-prioritization) because employee-facing time registration UX is prerequisite to meaningful testing of advanced rules. Phase 3 shifts to Sprints 10–11.

- **Sprint 9** (complete): Skema monthly grid replaces 3 separate pages, backend-persisted timer (Tjek ind/Tjek ud), two-step approval flow (employee self-approve → manager approve), org-scoped project management, agreement-driven absence type rows with LocalAdmin visibility control, JWT claim remapping fix. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-9.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-9.md).

#### Impact Assessment (Tier 2 Re-prioritization)

**Affected sprints**:
- S9 (was: Advanced Rules Phase 3 start) → Now: Skema feature
- S10-S11 (was: Advanced Rules Phase 3 completion) → Now: Phase 3 start, shifted +1 sprint

**Scope changes**:
- Phase 3 unchanged in content — only shifted forward by one sprint
- No sprint needs splitting or merging
- No new prerequisites introduced (Skema consumes existing events/models)

**Updated phase-sprint ranges**:
- Phase 2b (Skema): Sprint 9 ← new
- Phase 3 (Advanced Rules): Sprints 10–11 (was 9–10)
- Phase 3c (Agreement Config Management): Sprint 12 ← new (re-prioritized from Phase 4)
- Phase 3d (Employee Experience): Sprint 13
- Phase 3e (Position Override + Wage Type Mapping UI): Sprint 14
- Phase 3f (Compliance, Entitlements & Overtime Governance): Sprints 15–17
- Phase 3g (UI/UX Refinements): Sprint 18
- Phase 4 (Production): Sprint 19+ (was 18+, then 15+, then 14+, then 12+, then 11+)

### Phase 3 — Advanced Rules + Retroactive Corrections (Sprints 10–11)

**Priority focus**: P2 (Deterministic rule engine), P4 (Version correctness), P6 (Payroll integration)

Depends on the connected payroll chain from Phase 1. These sprints tackle the most complex rule domains and prove the architecture works end-to-end across time.

- **Sprint 10** (complete): Tech debt cleanup (idempotency guard, FlexEvaluationResponse DTO, config dict dedup, smoke test fix, GetDescendantsAsync optimization) + Rule engine expansion (4-week norm periods, part-time pro rata, call-in work, travel time). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-10.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-10.md).
- **Sprint 11** (complete): Retroactive OK version split recalculation, delta/correction SLS export, AC position-based rule overrides with controlled position registry (Option C), academic/research annual norm model (ANNUAL_ACTIVITY), NormCheckRule cleanup, NORM_DEVIATION wage type, ADR-013 (no cascade), 35 new tests (306 total). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-11.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-11.md).

### Phase 3c — Agreement Configuration Management (Sprint 12)

**Priority focus**: P1 (Architectural integrity), P2 (Deterministic rule engine — preservation), P3 (Event sourcing), P7 (Security)

Moves agreement configs from static code to database, enabling GlobalAdmin self-service management through UI. The rule engine remains pure — only the config source changes.

- **Sprint 12** (complete): DB-backed agreement configs (ADR-014), agreement_configs table with Draft/Active/Archived lifecycle, seed migration from CentralAgreementConfigs, AgreementConfigRepository, ConfigResolutionService rewiring, GlobalAdmin API endpoints (CRUD + clone + publish + archive), agreement management frontend page (overview + editor + diff view), validation rules, comprehensive tests. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-12.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-12.md).

### Phase 3d — Employee Experience: Unified "Min Tid" (Sprint 13)

**Priority focus**: P9 (Usability), P7 (Security)

**Re-prioritized** (Tier 1): Sprint 13 was projected for "Position Override + Wage Type Mapping UI". Re-prioritized to employee experience consolidation — balance overview + time registration + month approval on one page. Position Override + Wage Type Mapping UI shifts to Sprint 14.

- **Sprint 13** (complete): Balance summary endpoint (flex, vacation, norm, overtime), BalanceSummary component with 4 responsive cards, SkemaPage integration, sidebar rename "Skema" → "Min Tid", "Mine perioder" removed from primary nav. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-13.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-13.md).

### Phase 3e — Position Override + Wage Type Mapping UI (Sprint 14)

**Priority focus**: P6 (Payroll integration), P7 (Security), P9 (Usability)

Extends the DB-backed config pattern to position overrides and wage type mappings. Reuses the architecture established in Sprint 12.

- **Sprint 14** (complete): 3 new DB tables (position_override_configs, audit tables), PositionOverrideConfigEntity + 4 domain events, WageTypeMapping Position property + 3 domain events, PositionOverrideRepository + WageTypeMappingRepository, ConfigResolutionService DB-first position override lookup with static fallback, 12 GlobalAdmin CRUD endpoints (7 position override + 5 wage type mapping), 2 admin pages (Positionstilpasninger + Lønartstilknytninger), 22 new tests (406 total). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-14.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-14.md).

### Phase 3f — Compliance, Entitlements & Overtime Governance (Sprints 15–17)

**Priority focus**: P2 (Deterministic rule engine), P4 (Version correctness), P6 (Payroll integration)

Addresses gaps identified in ontology analysis (2026-03-09). These are correctness requirements — without them the system can produce results that violate legal constraints or lack necessary balance tracking for accurate payroll export.

**New SYSTEM_TARGET.md sections**: J (Working Time Compliance), K (Entitlement & Balance Management), L (Overtime Governance), M (Compensation Model)

- **Sprint 15** — Entitlement & Balance Management
  - Entitlement model: annual quotas for vacation (25 days, ferieår Sep–Aug), special holiday days, care days (2/year), senior days (age-based), child sick days (per-episode)
  - Entitlement configuration per agreement (quota, accrual model, reset date, carryover max, part-time pro-rate)
  - Balance tracking: entitlement used/remaining/planned, carryover from previous year
  - Validation: absence registration rejected or warned when quota exceeded
  - Balance summary endpoint extended with entitlement data
  - Norm reduction: vacation days reduce period norm correctly (days × daily norm hours)
  - DB tables: `entitlements`, `entitlement_balances`, `entitlement_config`

- **Sprint 16** — Working Time Compliance
  - Rest period validation rule: 11-hour daily rest, weekly rest day
  - `MaxDailyHours`, `MinimumRestHours`, `RestPeriodDerogationAllowed` on AgreementRuleConfig
  - `WeeklyMaxHoursReferencePeriod` for 48h/week EU directive ceiling
  - NormCheckRule extended with daily limit validation
  - Compliance warnings surfaced in Skema UI (employee) and approval dashboard (leader)
  - Compensatory rest tracking when derogation is used

- **Sprint 17** — Overtime Governance & Compensation Model
  - Afspadsering as explicit concept: separate from flex, with conversion rates
  - Overtime balance (separate from flex balance): accumulated, reduced by afspadsering or payout
  - `DefaultCompensationModel`, `EmployeeCompensationChoice`, `MaxOvertimeHoursPerPeriod` on config
  - `OvertimeRequiresPreApproval` flag (workflow gate, not rule engine)
  - New wage type mappings: OVERTIME_50_PAYOUT, OVERTIME_50_AFSPADSERING, OVERTIME_100_PAYOUT, OVERTIME_100_AFSPADSERING, MERARBEJDE_PAYOUT, MERARBEJDE_AFSPADSERING
  - Leader dashboard: overtime exceeded warnings, pre-approval tracking

### Phase 3g — Codex BLOCKER Remediation (Sprints 18–19)

**Priority focus**: P2 (Deterministic rule engine), P4 (Version correctness), P6 (Payroll integration), P7 (Security), P3 (Event sourcing)

**Re-prioritized (Tier 2, 2026-04-18 and 2026-04-23)**: Sprint 18 was originally Phase 3g "UI/UX Refinements." The Codex external review ([`docs/reviews/codex-2026-04-18.md`](docs/reviews/codex-2026-04-18.md)) surfaced 4 BLOCKERs and 6 WARNINGs against core priorities P2–P7. Stabilizing correctness before a UX polish pass is the right order — P9 (Usability) must not compromise higher priorities. Sprint 18's own Step 7a Codex review (2026-04-23) then surfaced 2 new BLOCKERs and 3 WARNINGs — genuine scope-enforcement regressions in the S18 remediation (role-level auth treated as per-org scoping). Sprint 19 extends Phase 3g for Round 2 remediation ([docs/sprints/SPRINT-19.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-19.md)). UI/UX Refinements + Production Hardening shift forward by one sprint each.

**Scope**: Five remediation tasks targeting the highest-impact Codex findings (Recs #1, #3, #4, #6, #8). No new features.

- **TASK-1801** — OK-version resolution enforcement at write + payroll boundary. Server-resolve `OkVersion` from entry/absence date; reject or override caller-supplied mismatches. Fixes Codex BLOCKER #4 (priorities 2–4). Agent: Rule Engine + API Integration. Effort: M.
- **TASK-1802** — Wage-type mapping lookup fix. Reconcile `position NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` schema with `IS NULL` query semantics; pass actual `profile.Position` through payroll mapping paths. Fixes Codex BLOCKER #6 (priorities 5–6). Agent: Payroll Integration + Data Model. Effort: M.
- **TASK-1803** — Role-scope orchestrator / payroll / recalculate endpoints. `recalculate` → admin-only; export → internal/admin-scoped; orchestrator execution not reachable by employee tokens. Fixes Codex BLOCKER #7 (priority 7). Agent: Security. Effort: S.
- **TASK-1804** — EventSerializer coverage test. Reflect over `DomainEventBase` descendants and fail the test if any are missing from `EventSerializer._eventTypeMap`. Add `UserUpdated` to the map (currently missing). Fixes Codex WARNING on dim. 3 (priorities 3, 8). Agent: Test & QA + Data Model. Effort: S.
- **TASK-1805** — OK-version runtime regression tests. Cover backend registration, weekly calculation, and payroll split/replay paths — not just the resolver utility. Validates TASK-1801. Recs #8 (priorities 2–4, 8). Agent: Test & QA. Effort: M.

**Explicitly deferred to S19 or later**:
- Codex BLOCKER #5 (Outbox delivery — payroll background consumer + external transactional claim). Effort L, 2–3 sprints. Plan in S19 detail.
- Codex Rec #2 (Remove Infrastructure dep from RuleEngine). Effort M. P1 concern but isolated; schedule S19 or S20.
- Codex Rec #7 (CI expansion — smoke + vitest). Effort S. Schedule S19.
- Codex Rec #9 (Governance drift-check CI step). Effort S. S19 or later.
- Codex Rec #10 (Split AdminEndpoints/TimeEndpoints). Effort L. Phase 4.

#### Impact Assessment (Tier 2 Re-prioritization, 2026-04-18)

**Affected sprints**:
- S18 (was: Phase 3g UI/UX Refinements) → Now: Phase 3g Codex BLOCKER Remediation
- S19 (was: Phase 4 start) → Now: Phase 3h UI/UX Refinements
- S20+ (was: continuation of Phase 4) → Now: Phase 4 Production Hardening start

**Scope changes**:
- UI/UX Refinements scope unchanged — shifted forward by one sprint (S18 → S19)
- Phase 4 shifted forward by one sprint
- No sprint needs splitting or merging
- No new prerequisites introduced beyond what Codex findings surfaced

**Updated phase-sprint ranges**:
- Phase 3f (Compliance, Entitlements & Overtime Governance): Sprints 15–17 (unchanged)
- Phase 3g (Codex BLOCKER Remediation): Sprint 18 ← new
- Phase 3h (UI/UX Refinements): Sprint 19 ← was Phase 3g S18
- Phase 4 (Production Hardening): Sprint 20+ ← was Sprint 19+

**Rationale**: CLAUDE.md priority order mandates lower priorities never compromise higher ones. Codex surfaced concrete P2–P7 gaps that would be written into production if shipped behind a UX polish sprint. Remediation must come first.

#### Impact Assessment (Tier 2 Re-prioritization, 2026-04-23 — S19 Round 2)

**Trigger**: S18 Step 7a Codex review (2026-04-23) surfaced 2 BLOCKERs + 3 WARNINGs. User-approved exit deferred all 5 findings to Sprint 19 rather than iterating Codex a third cycle.

**Affected sprints**:
- S18 (Phase 3g Round 1): complete with deferred findings recorded in the External Review section
- S19 (was: Phase 3h UI/UX Refinements) → Now: Phase 3g Round 2 Codex Remediation — the 5 deferred findings
- S20 (was: Phase 4 start) → unchanged content — an already-drafted "Temporal Period Handling" architectural sprint ([docs/sprints/SPRINT-20.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-20.md)) remains in S20. This sprint generalizes the effective-date-boundary pattern surfaced by TASK-1801 + TASK-1903.
- S21 (was: Phase 4 continuation) → Now: Phase 3h UI/UX Refinements — shifted forward
- S22+ (was: Phase 4 continuation) → Now: Phase 4 Production Hardening — shifted forward

**Scope changes**:
- S19 scope: 5 remediation tasks (TASK-1901 … TASK-1905). No new architectural ground. Two P7 scope-enforcement fixes (TASK-1901, TASK-1902) dominate effort.
- UI/UX Refinements scope unchanged — shifted forward by one sprint (S19 → S21)
- Phase 4 shifted forward by one sprint (S20+ → S22+)
- Temporal Period Handling (S20) remains in place and is thematically continuous with the OK-version work in S18/S19

**Updated phase-sprint ranges**:
- Phase 3g (Codex BLOCKER Remediation): Sprints 18–19 ← was Sprint 18 only
- Phase 3h (Temporal Period Handling, architectural): Sprint 20 ← was planned standalone, now formally the next phase
- Phase 3i (UI/UX Refinements): Sprint 21 ← was Phase 3h S19
- Phase 4 (Production Hardening): Sprint 22+ ← was Sprint 20+

**Rationale**: Two of the 5 findings are genuine P7 scope-enforcement holes (not just UX polish). Deferring BLOCKERs through UX or architectural sprints would ship known scope-bypass endpoints to production. S19 closes them first; S20's architectural Temporal Period Handling then generalizes what S18/S19 tackled tactically; only then does S21 (UI/UX) fit the priority order.

#### Impact Assessment (Tier 2 Re-prioritization, 2026-04-25 — Local Config Rework + UX deferred to launch)

**Trigger**: User analysis of the local agreement configuration UX (2026-04-25) confirmed the implementation is patch-shaped (per-key rows with no uniqueness) where the intended model is profile-shaped (one local agreement profile per `(org, agreement, OkVersion)` with an editable subset of fields). User direction: add the rework as a dedicated sprint after S20, and push UI/UX Refinements to the absolute end so it polishes a stable post-hardening surface rather than a moving target.

**Affected sprints**:
- S21 (was: Phase 3i UI/UX Refinements) → Now: Phase 3i Local Agreement Configuration Rework — analysis-first, structurally similar to S20
- S22+ (was: Phase 4 Production Hardening) → unchanged in content and starting position
- UI/UX Refinements: moved to **Phase 5**, final pre-launch sprint, sprint number TBD once Phase 4's actual length is known

**Scope changes**:
- New Phase 3i sprint defined: drained the S21 slot of UI/UX work and replaced it with the local-config rework
- Phase 4 unchanged
- New Phase 5 introduced for the deferred UX polish — placed last in the rolling-detail roadmap with no fixed sprint number (assigned when Phase 4 closes)

**Updated phase-sprint ranges**:
- Phase 3g (Codex BLOCKER Remediation): Sprints 18–19 (unchanged)
- Phase 3h (Temporal Period Handling): Sprint 20 (unchanged)
- Phase 3i (Local Agreement Configuration Rework): Sprint 21 ← repurposed
- Phase 4 (Production Hardening): Sprint 22+ (unchanged)
- Phase 5 (UI/UX Refinements): final pre-launch sprint, TBD ← new, replaces the previous Phase 3i UX content

**Rationale**: The local-config implementation does not match the intended model (one profile per agreement with an editable field subset). Today's flat patch table allows multiple conflicting active rows per key and gives admins no UX signal about which fields are adjustable. This is an admin-correctness gap, not just polish — it belongs in Phase 3 alongside the other correctness sprints (S18/S19/S20). UX polish then naturally moves to Phase 5 where it operates on a stable, hardened surface; this also avoids re-doing UX work as Phase 4 introduces monitoring widgets, performance instrumentation, and other surface-affecting changes.

### Phase 3g Round 2 — Codex BLOCKER Remediation (Sprint 19)

**Priority focus**: P7 (Security) — resource scope enforcement, P4 (Version correctness) — export-boundary mixed-version handling, P3 (Auditability) — retroactive event canonicalization

**Scope**: Four remediation tasks targeting the 2026-04-23 Codex findings. No new features. The fifth finding (mixed-version export boundary, originally TASK-1903) was folded into S20 on 2026-04-25 — see decision note below. Full task detail in [docs/sprints/SPRINT-19.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-19.md).

- **TASK-1901** — Orchestrator `/execute` resource-scope validation. Reject when caller's scope does not cover `parameters.employeeId`. Agent: Security + API Integration. Effort: M.
- **TASK-1902** — `/api/payroll/calculate-and-export` per-org scope validation (or escalate to GlobalAdminOnly). Plus policy-wiring test addressing internal-Reviewer WARNING. Agent: Security + Payroll. Effort: M.
- **TASK-1903** — *Absorbed into S20 (2026-04-25)*. The mixed-version export boundary symptom is one specific call site of the general temporal-segmentation problem S20 generalises. Pre-production status removes the live-exposure pressure that would have justified a tactical S19 patch.
- **TASK-1904** — Canonicalize OkVersion in single-version `RetroactiveCorrectionRequested` audit event. Agent: Payroll + Data Model. Effort: S.
- **TASK-1905** — JWT dev-fallback honors both `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT` and `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT` via `IHostEnvironment.IsDevelopment()`. Agent: Security. Effort: S.

### Phase 3h — Temporal Period Handling (Sprint 20)

**Priority focus**: P1 (Architectural integrity), P2 (Deterministic rule engine), P4 (Version correctness)

Analysis-first architectural sprint (ADR + task decomposition before implementation). Generalizes "calculation periods that intersect effective-date boundaries" — OK version transitions, agreement-config promotion, position-override effective dates, wage-type revisions, compliance-rule versioning, employee-profile changes. S18's TASK-1801 and S19's TASK-1903 tackle this reactively for OK version only; S20 produces the general solution. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-20.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-20.md) for the problem framing.

### Phase 3i — Local Agreement Configuration Rework (Sprint 21)

**Priority focus**: P1 (Architectural integrity), P7 (Security — admin-facing correctness), P9 (Usability — admin form discoverability)

Restructures local configuration from a flat "one value at a time" patch bag into a profile model: **one local agreement profile per `(org, agreementCode, OkVersion)`**, with the overridable subset of fields exposed as editable inputs and the rest pinned to central. Today's `local_configurations` table allows multiple active rows per `(org, key)` with no uniqueness constraint and the UX gives admins no signal about which fields are adjustable. See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-21.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-21.md) for the full problem statement and open architectural questions.

Analysis-first sprint (ADR + task decomposition before implementation), structurally similar to S20.

### Phase 4 — Production Hardening (Sprints 22–~29)

**Priority focus**: All priorities — cross-cutting production readiness.

Only makes sense once functional correctness is achieved. The final UX polish pass (Phase 5) follows production hardening so layout, performance, and instrumentation are settled before visual lockdown.

Functional coverage at Phase 4 entry: **~96%** (unchanged from end of S17 — S18-S22 added zero functional coverage; all five were correctness/hardening sprints). The Phase 4 backlog is thus structured as **pattern-propagation sub-sprints** rather than open-ended hardening work. Each sub-sprint has a named architectural exemplar in production already.

#### Phase 4a — Transactional Outbox + Row-Version Atomic Exemplar (Sprint 22) — COMPLETE

S22 (committed `a278f34` on 2026-05-05) delivered ADR-018: `IOutboxEnqueue`/`OutboxPublisher` split-interface design, row-version optimistic-concurrency token replacing S21's profile_id-as-ETag, end-exclusive `effective_to` semantics, UPDATE-in-place same-day routing with `MODIFIED` audit-action. `ConfigEndpoints` PUT is the atomic exemplar — single `(conn, tx)` carries profile mutation + audit row + outbox enqueue, committing together. The 12 other state-change endpoints + 8 repos still post-commit `AppendAsync` per S22's Option C scope narrowing — Phase 4c propagates the exemplar.

Step 7a Codex cycle 1 fixed P2 (same-day in-place response echoed wrong CreatedBy/CreatedAt) → cycle 2 fixed P1 (per-stream FIFO violated under transient publish failure) → cycle 3 hit the cycle-cap discipline with 2 P2 cascade findings routed to Phase 4b.

#### Phase 4b — Publisher Hardening (~1 sprint)

Absorbs S22 Step-7a cycle-3 cascade findings + Reviewer WARNINGs deferred per cycle-cap discipline:

- **Outbox max-attempts cap** (Reviewer WARN-2 / Codex P3) — `OutboxPublisher.ReadBatchAsync` lacks `WHERE attempts < @maxAttempts`, so permanently-broken rows hot-loop forever. The `idx_outbox_attempts` partial index already exists for the predicate. Add the cap + an ops-dashboard query for stuck rows.
- **Correlation_id parse robustness** (Reviewer WARN-4) — `OutboxPublisher.cs:343-346` `Guid.TryParse` on TEXT body silently returns `DBNull.Value` on bad input, losing the audit-chain link. Either log a warning or store TEXT consistently across `events` + `outbox_events`.
- **Frontend CORS ETag fallback** (Codex cycle-3 P2) — `frontend/src/api/profileApi.ts:73-75` `res.headers.get('ETag')` returns null in cross-origin deployments unless the API exposes the header. Fall back to `data.version` from the response body. Sibling backend fix: `Access-Control-Expose-Headers: ETag` when CORS middleware is fully configured.
- **Same-day no-op short-circuit** (Codex cycle-3 P2) — when `changedFields.Count == 0 && isInPlaceEdit`, `ConfigEndpoints` PUT or `LocalAgreementProfileRepository.SupersedeAndCreateAsync` should return the predecessor unchanged with the existing version + ETag, rather than bumping version + emitting MODIFIED audit/event with empty `changedFields`.
- **Reviewer NOTEs absorbed**: NOTE-1 (412 fallback robustness — wrap recovery `GetCurrentOpenAsync` in try/catch), NOTE-3 (weak ETag validators `W/"5"` parsed as null in `parseVersionFromETag`), NOTE-4 (D12 coverage gaps: concurrent enqueue across two endpoints competing for same stream_id; sustained publisher load above ~6 rows; backfill on already-shifted rows).

#### Phase 4c — Site Propagation: TASK-2206 redo + D2.2 ETag propagation (~2 sprints, sibling pair)

Both share S22's row-version + end-exclusive design — copy-and-adapt work, not new architecture.

- **TASK-2206 redo** (S22 Option C carry-forward): 8-repo `(conn, tx)` overload refactor + 10-file site swap to use S22's single-tx atomic pattern. Touches `ApprovalPeriodRepository`, `AgreementConfigRepository`, `PositionOverrideRepository`, `WageTypeMappingRepository`, `OvertimePreApprovalRepository`, `OvertimeBalanceRepository`, `TimerSessionRepository`, `EntitlementBalanceRepository`, plus the endpoint sites that consume them. Reference shape: the 4 batch commits on `worktree-agent-a9b76f8d1f88717ff` (`c615dba` / `1466af9` / `c0093e6` / `2aa3044`) preserved for site-shape but **NOT to be merged** — they violate atomicity by introducing a separate tx wrapping only the outbox enqueue.
- **D2.2 ETag/If-Match propagation** (ADR-019 placeholder, S21 D2.2 carry-forward): row-version + ETag pattern propagated across `agreement_configs` (DRAFT edits), `position_overrides`, `wage_type_mappings`, `entitlement_configs`. Each surface gains an `If-Match`/`If-None-Match` contract on its mutating endpoint(s); `OptimisticConcurrencyException` maps to 412 with `(expectedVersion, actualVersion, currentState)` body. End-exclusive `effective_to` semantics for any history-shaped surface.

#### Phase 4d — Versioned History for Non-Dated Boundary Sources (3 sub-sprints, S20 Q5b carry-forward)

Completes the temporal-segmentation correctness story for the three sources S20 left as snapshot-at-calculation. Each source moves from "snapshot the current row at calculation time, embed in segment manifest" to "look up the row effective on segment date." Existing manifests remain replayable; new manifests use the historical lookup. No retroactive recomputation of past calculations. **Hard dependency**: S20's `SnapshotContract` framework + segment manifest must be in place (it is).

- **Phase 4d-1: Wage-type-mapping versioned history** — add `effective_from` / history-row semantics to `wage_type_mappings`. Simplest of the three; admin-managed, infrequent writes. Folds in the S20 carry-forward "WTM snapshot for full replay determinism" (`MapSegmentToExportLinesAsync` currently reads live DB during export-line stage).
- **Phase 4d-2: Entitlement-policy versioned history** — same pattern; admin-managed config table. Pairs with `entitlement_configs` from Phase 4c.
- **Phase 4d-3: Employee-profile versioned history** — hardest. The `employees` table is read by every rule, has many fields, has self-service + HR + leader edit paths. Versioning means every edit creates a history row; UI surfaces "as of date" semantics; per-field decision (e.g., display name → last-write-wins; agreement code, hours fraction, employment category → versioned). May itself decompose into multiple sprints.

#### Phase 4e — General Hardening (~1-2 sprints)

- Performance profiling and optimization
- Monitoring, alerting, health checks
- Real SLS integration (replacing mock)
- Load testing, stress testing
- Security audit, penetration testing
- Documentation and operational runbooks
- **S20 small-task absorbtion**: non-OK boundary-source hydration in `BuildPlanForLegacyCallers` (agreement-config / position-override / EU-WTD lists currently empty extension points); `StampAuditContext` wiring through Backend → Payroll proxy when audit chain reaches Payroll; retire the last `[Obsolete] CalculateAsync` call site at `/calculate-and-export`; `FlexBalanceRule` chained-carry custom delegate (currently `MergeStrategy.Custom` falls back to `FallbackCustomMerge`); `TestFixtures.RuleSet` drift-detection test against `HttpRuleClassificationProvider`.
- **S21 test-harness debt**: tests #11/#12/#16 hand-roll PUT pipeline (could use `WebApplicationFactory<Program>`); reflection on private methods in tests #8-10/#14 (future small task with `[InternalsVisibleTo]`); `ProfileTestSchema.cs` / `LegacyProfileSchema.cs` DDL drift vs `init.sql` is silent today.

### Phase 5 — UI/UX Refinements (final pre-launch sprint, projected ~Sprint 30)

**Priority focus**: P9 (Usability)

Final polish pass before launch — deferred from its original S18 / S21 slots so it lands on a stable, hardened backend rather than a moving target. Projected as ~S30 based on Phase 4 sub-sprint count (Phase 4a complete S22; Phase 4b ~1; Phase 4c ~2; Phase 4d ~3; Phase 4e ~1-2). Sprint number finalised when Phase 4d-3 (employee-profile versioned history) lands and its true sprint count is known. Scope unchanged from the original S18 plan.

- Visual consistency audit: token usage, spacing, alignment across all pages
- Responsive layout improvements (mobile/tablet breakpoints)
- Form validation UX: inline errors, field-level feedback, loading states
- Accessibility audit: keyboard navigation, ARIA labels, focus management, contrast ratios
- Error and empty states: meaningful messages, retry actions, skeleton loaders
- Navigation and information architecture review
- Toast/notification consolidation and consistency
- Data table improvements: sorting, filtering, pagination UX
- Skema grid usability refinements based on workflow testing
- Approval flow UX: clearer status indicators, action confirmations

**Phase 3d complete**: Sprint 13 delivers unified employee experience. Overall functional coverage: ~97%.

## Sprint 14 — Completed

Sprint 14 completed Phase 3e (Position Override + Wage Type Mapping UI). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-14.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-14.md) for full task log.

**Phase 3e complete**: Sprint 14 delivers full admin management for position overrides and wage type mappings. Overall functional coverage: ~98%.

## Sprint 16 — Completed

Sprint 16 completed Phase 3f part 2 (Working Time Compliance). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-16.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-16.md) for full task log.

**Key deliverables**: EU Working Time Directive 2003/88/EC compliance — RestPeriodRule (pure static, 4 checks: 11h daily rest, weekly rest day, 48h/week ceiling, max daily hours), 5 compliance config fields on AgreementRuleConfig, VoluntaryUnsocialHours on TimeEntry/TimeEntryRegistered events, ComplianceCheckResult model (ADR-015), compensatory_rest table, config resolution chain propagation (DB→Repository→Seeder→ConfigResolution→Entity→Endpoints), ComplianceWarnings component on SkemaPage, compliance badges in ApprovalDashboard, 14 new unit tests (436 total).

**ADR-015**: ComplianceCheckResult is a separate return type from CalculationResult — justified divergence from PAT-006 because compliance results are validation outputs (violation/warning lists), not payroll calculations (wage lines).

## Sprint 17 — Completed

Sprint 17 completed Phase 3f part 3 (Overtime Governance & Compensation Model). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-17.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-17.md) for full task log.

**Phase 3f complete**: Sprints 15–17 delivered entitlements, working time compliance, and overtime governance. Overall functional coverage: ~95%.

## Sprint 22 — Completed

Sprint 22 completed Phase 4a (Transactional Outbox + Row-Version Atomic Exemplar). See [docs/sprints/SPRINT-22.md](docs/sprints/SPRINT-22.md) for full task log.

**Key deliverables**: ADR-018 D1-D12 (`outbox_events` + `schema_migrations` ledger + `version BIGINT` on profiles + end-exclusive `effective_to` + audit-action MODIFIED). `IOutboxEnqueue` split-interface lives in Infrastructure (cycle-6 design) preserves SharedKernel Npgsql purity. `PostgresEventStore : IEventStore, IOutboxEnqueue` dual-binding. `OutboxPublisher` BackgroundService — per-stream FIFO + 4-way cross-stream parallelism, ReadCommitted publisher tx, event_id correlation on 23505. `LocalAgreementProfileRepository` UPDATE-in-place same-day routing (CREATED / MODIFIED / SUPERSEDED audit-action). `ConfigEndpoints` PUT atomic exemplar — version-as-ETag (RFC 7232 quoted long), three-way audit, in-tx EnqueueAsync replaces post-commit AppendAsync. Frontend ETag helpers (`lib/etag.ts` parseVersionFromETag/formatVersionAsIfMatch). 16 D12 Docker-gated regression scenarios across `OutboxPublisherTests`/`ProfileRowVersionTests`/`EndExclusiveMigrationTests`/`EventStoreInTxTests`. Build 0/0; 517 unit + 35 plain regression + 50 Docker-gated total = 650.

**Option C scope narrowing (2026-05-04)**: TASK-2206 (8-repo `(conn, tx)` refactor + 10-file site swap) deferred to Phase 4c sub-sprint. ConfigEndpoints stands as the atomic exemplar; the other ~12 state-change endpoints still post-commit `AppendAsync` until 4c lands. Reference shape preserved on `worktree-agent-a9b76f8d1f88717ff` (NOT to be merged).

**Step 7a Codex (3 cycles)**: Cycle 1 P2 fix — `ConfigEndpoints` PUT response now uses `predecessor.CreatedBy/CreatedAt` on UPDATE-in-place branch (where the repo preserves them). Cycle 2 P1 fix — `OutboxPublisher` per-stream foreach `continue` → `break` to preserve ADR-018 D5 FIFO under transient publish failures. Cycle 3 cascade halted per `feedback_step7a_cycle_cap_discipline.md`: 2 new P2 findings (frontend CORS ETag fallback + same-day no-op short-circuit) routed to Phase 4b.

**Phase 4a complete**: Sprint 22 delivered the atomic state-change exemplar. Phase 4b-e propagate the pattern. Functional coverage unchanged at ~96% (all S18-S22 work was correctness/hardening; functional features were complete after S17). Committed `a278f34` on 2026-05-05.
