## Context

Building the "glue" between Rule Engine and Payroll Export required defining how the Payroll service invokes Rule Engine rules while maintaining service boundary isolation.

## Pattern

The `PeriodCalculationService` calls the Rule Engine via HTTP POST for each rule type:
- Time rules (`NORM_CHECK_37H`, `SUPPLEMENT_CALC`, `OVERTIME_CALC`) via `/api/rules/evaluate`
- Absence via `/api/rules/evaluate-absence`
- Flex balance via `/api/rules/evaluate-flex`

It uses camelCase JSON serialization with case-insensitive deserialization. The flex endpoint returns `FlexBalanceResult` (not `CalculationResult`), requiring special parsing via `JsonDocument` to extract `excessForPayout`.

Each `PayrollExportLine` includes `SourceRuleId` and `SourceTimeType` for end-to-end traceability:
```
Time Event → Rule Evaluation (SourceRuleId) → TimeType (SourceTimeType) → WageType → Export File
```

## Rationale

This pattern ensures the payroll service never directly invokes rule engine functions (P1 Architectural integrity, P5 Integration isolation) while maintaining the full traceability chain required by DEP-002.

## Agent Guidance

- Never import or reference Rule Engine assemblies from the Payroll project
- Always include `SourceRuleId` and `SourceTimeType` on `PayrollExportLine` for audit trail
- The flex endpoint response format is `FlexBalanceResult`, not `CalculationResult` — parse with `JsonDocument`
- Sprint 5 improvement: consider unifying the flex endpoint to return `CalculationResult` with line items
